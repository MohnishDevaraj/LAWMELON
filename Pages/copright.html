   <h1>HISTORY OF COPYRIGHT</h1>
   <p></p>

   <p>
    The development of copyright law in the United Kingdom may be linked to Johannes Gutenberg’s creation of 
    the printing press in Germany in 1440. When the printing machine made its way to England in 1483, King Richard III lifted the 
    restriction on the importation of books and manuscripts. The Stationer’s Guild was established in 1529 to control the printing industry 
    when authors started bringing their works to England for printing. In 1516, King Henry VII instituted a privilege system that gave guild 
    members the only authority to reproduce materials.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    In order to protect English publishers and printers, King Henry I forbade the importation of books and stationery in 1533. 
    After obtaining a royal charter in 1557, the Stationer’s Company was given the power to control the book trade. The idea of copyright was created 
    by the Licencing Act of 1661, which gave Stationer’s Company members the freedom to publish. The 1662 statute gave the organisation the authority to prosecute copyright violations. 
    But because the Licencing Act could not sufficiently handle mechanical and intellectual theft, it was finally abolished in 1681.

   <p>
    Authors’ rights were recognised by the world’s first copyright law, the Statute of Anne, which went into effect on April 10, 1710, and completely changed the field of copyright law. 
    Its primary objectives were to safeguard writers against piracy and to encourage study. According to the legislation, writers were granted the only right to print their unpublished writings for a period of 14 years, 
    with the possibility of an extra 14 years if the author continued to live. Violators would have to pay penalties and lose the infringing books.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    The Berne Convention was put into effect and other measures were combined into the Copyright Act of 1911. It did away with the need for previous registration and increased the copyright's duration to life plus 50 years. 
    In addition to introducing quick remedies for infringement claims, the legislation protected all forms of art.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    Let’s begin by discussing the development of copyright law in India. In 1847, the East India Company was in power when the country passed its first copyright legislation. The statute gave the author a lifetime plus seven 
    further years or forty-two years of copyright protection. Also, it empowered the government to issue publication licenses if the copyright owner declined. Following the 1911 English legislation, the Act of 1914 extended copyright protection to all literary and artistic creations.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    The 1911 statute was superseded by the Copyright statute of 1957 upon India’s independence. It created a copyright board to resolve disputes and a copyright office for registration. The measure significantly altered India’s copyright laws.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    In conclusion, copyright law has a convoluted and centuries-long history. The law is always changing to meet new issues as technology advances, particularly when it comes to non-literal works. To reduce subjectivity and appropriately combat copyright infringement, more precise legislation are required.

   <h4>COPYRIGHT OWNERSHIP AND FIRST OWNERSHIP UNDER COPYRIGHT ACT, 1957</h4>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    Copyright is a unique legal right that is automatically granted upon the creation of a work. It is closely tied to the creator of the work and differs from trademarks, where the originator might not be known. The author’s role is significant in copyright, mentioned during registration and enforcement.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    First Ownership by Type of Work:
   </p>
   <p>
    1.Literary, Artistic, Dramatic, Musical Work: The author is the initial owner. This includes books, computer software, online content, and public speeches.
   </p>
   <p>
    2. Photograph, Sculpture, Drawing (including architectural drawings), Plan, Engraving: The author is the first owner.
   </p>
   <p>
    3. Cinematographic Work: The producer is the first owner. However, authors of lyrics, music, and dramatic elements in the work retain their rights for other purposes.
   </p>
   <p>
    4. Sound Recording: The producer is the first owner.
   </p>
   <p>
    5. Work Created by Contract: If a person commissions any work through a contract, that person becomes the first owner for the purpose of the contract. The author remains the first owner for all other purposes.
   </p>
   <p>
    6. Work Created by Employee: If a work is created by an employee during employment, the employer is the first owner. Disputes might arise regarding when the work was created 
    “in the course of” employment.
   </p>
   <p>
    7. Work Created by Partner: Work created by a partner during business operations becomes owned by the partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    8. Work Created under Contract of Service: The person who has instituted the service becomes the first owner. This is similar to an employer-employee relationship with the employer having control.
   </p>
   <p>
    9. Work Created under Contract for Service: The author retains first ownership under this arrangement, given their discretion in creating the work.
   </p>
   <p>
    10. Speech Delivered in Public: The speaker is the first owner, regardless of employment or arrangement by another.
   </p>

   <ul>
    <li>Written assignments are crucial to transfer copyright ownership from the author.</li>
    <li>Employment agreements clarify employer ownership.</li>
    <li>In cinematographic work, consent from actors, composers, lyricists, etc., must be provided.</li>
   </ul>
   <p></p>

    Section 17 of the Copyright Act, 1957 in India is a pivotal piece of legislation that delves into the intricate relationship between authorship and ownership of copyrighted works. 
    This section outlines the scenarios in which the ownership of copyright deviates from the default principle that the creator (author) of a work is the initial owner of its copyright.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    In essence, Section 17 provides a framework for determining who owns the copyright in various types of creative works when circumstances involve employment, 
    commissioned work, or certain contractual arrangements. This section allows for the transfer of ownership rights from the creator to another party under specific conditions. 
    It plays a crucial role in clarifying the intricacies of copyright ownership and authorship, especially in cases where the creation of a work is tied to a business, employer, or commissioned project.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    Section 17 is divided into different clauses, each addressing specific categories of creative works and the situations under which ownership of copyright may be attributed to parties other than the original creators:
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Section 17(a): This clause pertains to literary, dramatic, and artistic works. It states that if an author creates a work during the course of their employment or service to an entity such as a newspaper, magazine, book publisher, etc., 
    and under a contract that involves publishing such work, the owner of the entity shall be the first owner of the copyright, unless there’s an agreement stating otherwise.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    2. Section 17(b): This clause applies to works like photographs, paintings, engravings, and cinematographic films. It states that if an artist, photographer, or cinematographer is hired to create such a work, the person or entity commissioning 
    the work shall be the first owner of the copyright, unless there’s an agreement to the contrary.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    3. Section 17(c): Here, the focus is on works created during employment. If a person creates a work during the course of their employment under a contract of service or apprenticeship, the employer shall be the first owner of the copyright, unless otherwise agreed upon.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    4. Section 17(cc): This clause pertains to lectures delivered in public on behalf of someone else. If a person delivers a lecture on behalf of another, the person on whose behalf the lecture is delivered becomes the first owner of the copyright. If the person gives the lecture without representing someone else, they retain authorship and ownership rights.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    5. Section 17(d): It addresses works made at the instance of or under a government. If a work is created in response to a government’s request or tender, the government becomes the first owner of the copyright, unless there's a different agreement in place.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    6. Section 17(dd): This clause applies to copyrightable works made on behalf of public undertakings. If a work is created at the direction of a public undertaking, that undertaking shall be the first owner of the copyright.
   </p>
   <p>
    7. Section 17(dd) and Section 41: This pertains to works created for certain international organizations. If an international organization commissions a person to create a copyrightable work, that organization becomes the first owner of the copyright.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    In summary, Section 17 of the Copyright Act, 1957, is a legal tapestry that navigates the complex terrain of copyright ownership, considering various scenarios involving commissioned work, employment, public representation, and government involvement. It balances the scales between creators and entities that provide the platform for creative expression, 
    ensuring a fair distribution of ownership rights while recognizing the roles played by different parties in the creative process.
