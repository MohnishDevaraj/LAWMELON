    <h1>CONVENTIONS</h1>
    <h3>MADRID PROTOCOL:- A ROUTE TO GLOBAL BRANDING</h3>
    <p>
      Overall, TRIPS plays a vital role in promoting and protecting intellectual property rights globally. 
      By establishing minimum standards, harmonizing laws, and providing flexibility, it seeks to strike a 
      balance between incentivizing innovation, promoting access to essential goods and services, and addressing 
      the specific needs of different countries. TRIPS aims to create a robust and balanced intellectual property 
      framework that fosters economic growth, technological advancement, and the dissemination of knowledge worldwide. 
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Traditionally, you would need to file separate applications in each country where you want protection. After that, 
      you would have to follow various processes in each country to manage these rights, such as renewing them, allowing others to 
      use them, or transferring them to someone else.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      However, if you are from India or live in India, there is a more convenient and cost-effective way to secure and oversee your 
      trademark rights in other countries. It is called the Madrid Protocol, and India became a part of it in 2013.
    </p>
    <P></P>
    <p>
      The Madrid Protocol simplifies and reduces the cost of protecting your brand internationally. It offers a one-stop solution for filing 
      trademark applications and managing those registrations in foreign countries.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>MADRID UNION MEMBERS:-</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>The Madrid Union, a group of countries and international organizations, has 100 members, covering 116 countries. Many of these countries 
       are crucial trading partners with India, making it even more attractive.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>PROCEDURE:-</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
       You file a single application under the Madrid Protocol, indicating the countries where you want your trademark to be protected.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      This application is reviewed, registered, and published by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      WIPO then shares the details of your international registration with the countries you specified.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Each of these countries has a limited time to object. If they don’t object within 18 months, your trademark is automatically protected in their territory, 
      as if you applied directly to that country.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Once your international registration is secured and your brand is protected in the designated countries, you can easily manage it online through WIPO. 
      This includes renewing your trademark every ten years, expanding protection to new markets, and making various changes to your registration, like assigning 
      rights to someone else or updating your details.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>ADVANTAGES:-</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Filing your trademarks under the Madrid Protocol offers several key advantages:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simplified Process: You don’t have to file separate trademark applications in multiple countries. One international application covers all Madrid Protocol 
          member countries.</li>
      <li>Language Uniformity: You can file in a single language (English), eliminating the need for different language versions.</li>
      <li>Currency Convenience: Application fees are paid in a single currency (Swiss francs), removing the hassle of dealing with various currencies.</li>
      <li>Local Representative Costs: You don’t need to hire local representatives in each country; one application covers them all.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>The benefits extend beyond filing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Speedy Protection: Strict time limits for member countries to approve your trademark speed up the protection process.</li>
      <li>Central Management: After international registration, all management, including renewals and updates, happens in one place - WIPO.</li>
      <li>Cost Savings: You save on translation and various fees like those for local representatives and currency exchange.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p> 
    <p>
      These advantages are particularly helpful for small and medium-sized companies (SMEs). The Madrid system’s cost-saving features are crucial for businesses with 
      only a few international registrations.
    </p>   
    <p></p>
    <h4>OTHER BENEFITS:-</h4>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rapid International Presence: It helps your brand establish an international reputation quickly and generate goodwill.</li>
      <li>Strategic Opportunities: Companies can explore franchising, partner with international entrepreneurs for product development, and integrate into global supply chains.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Before applying, ensure your trademark is not excluded from protection by Indian law and isn’t already registered by someone else. Also, before protecting your mark abroad, check if 
      it’s already registered in your target markets. You can use online tools like TMview, a global platform that allows you to search trademark databases, including India’s TM Registry, for free. 
      TMview offers insights into trademark landscapes in many countries, making the process user-friendly. It provides access to information on millions of trademark applications and registrations worldwide, 
      including those under the Madrid system. Please note that the accuracy of the data in TMview relies on the participating trademark offices.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>PROCEDURE FOR FILING OF INTERNATIONAL TRADEMARK APPLICATION:-</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      1.	Eligibility: Individuals or businesses located in India can file. A valid “basic mark” must exist in India, either registered or applied for protection at the India Trade Marks Registry.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      2.	Filing Process: Submit an international application electronically through the IP India website using the designated form (MM2(E)) found under “International application originating from India” 
          at the comprehensive e-filing services gateway.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      3.	Required Information: 
    </p>
    <p></p>
         <p>1) Name and address.
    </p>
    <p></p> 
         <p>2)A representation of your trademark
    </p>
    <p></p> 
          <p>3) Identical to the basic mark in India 
    </p>
    <p></p>  
          <p>4) List of goods and services to be protected
    </p>
    <p></p>  
          <p>5) Matching those in the basic 
    </p>
    <p></p>  
          <p>6) Designation of Madrid Protocol member countries (Contracting Parties) where protection is desired.
    <p></p>
    <p>
      4.	Good Practices: Ensure accurate and clear indication of goods and services, following the Nice Classification. Madrid Goods & Services Manager (MGS), an online tool by WIPO, helps compile the list of 
          goods and services and check if they align with the Madrid system's procedures and requirements.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      5.	Designation of Contracting Parties: Specify the Madrid Protocol member countries where you want protection. Currently, there are up to 100 Contracting Parties, including 116 States and two intergovernmental 
          organizations (the European Union and the African Intellectual Property Organization).
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      6.	Fees: Pay the required fees in Swiss francs to WIPO. Some Contracting Parties may have individual fees. WIPO offers an online Fee Calculator for easy fee calculation and accepts payment by credit card, WIPO current account, or bank transfer. 
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      7.	Review by India Trade Marks Registry: The India Trade Marks Registry will check if the applicant matches the basic mark holder, the international mark matches the basic mark, and the goods and services align. If all conditions are met, 
          the international application is certified and transmitted to WIPO. If there are deficiencies, an online deficiency letter is issued.
    </p>   
    <p></p>
    <p>
      8.	WIPO Review: WIPO reviews the international application for classification accuracy and clear representation. If issues arise, WIPO sends an irregularity notice and grants a three-month period for corrections.
    </p>      
    <p></p>
    <p>
      9.	Registration and Publication: If the application aligns with requirements, WIPO registers the mark in the International Register, publishes it in the WIPO Gazette of International Marks, and notifies designated Contracting Parties. 
          An international registration certificate is provided to the applicant.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p> 
         Protection Period and Renewal: The mark enjoys protection in each designated Contracting Party for ten years, with the option for indefinite ten-year renewals. The holder can request modifications, changes in ownership, or license updates 
         to the International Register through WIPO.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      10.	Dependency Period: For the first five years, the international registration’s fate depends on the basic mark in India. If the basic mark loses its effect during this period, the international registration is cancelled accordingly.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      11.	Transformation: To mitigate this dependency, the Madrid Protocol allows transformation into national or regional applications within three months of cancellation. These new applications maintain the original filing date.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      12.	Independence: After the five-year dependency period, the international registration becomes independent and is not affected by changes in the basic mark's status.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>ONLINE TOOLS FOR MANAGING INTERNATIONAL REGISTRATION:-</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Madrid Monitor: This e-service by WIPO helps you track the status of international applications and registrations. It also provides detailed information on all marks registered via the Madrid system, including those of your competitors.

    <h3>Trade Related aspects of Intellectual Property rights (TRIPS)</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Scope and Coverage:</h4>
    <p>
      TRIPS covers various forms of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, 
      copyrights, geographical indications, industrial designs, trade secrets, and plant variety protection. 
      This broad coverage ensures that member countries have a comprehensive framework for protecting and 
      enforcing different types of intellectual property.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Minimum Standards and Harmonization:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      TRIPS establishes minimum standards for the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. 
      It requires member countries to adopt laws and regulations that meet these standards, ensuring a certain level 
      of consistency and uniformity in IP protection globally. This harmonization aims to facilitate international trade 
      and create a level playing field for businesses operating across borders.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>National Treatment:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The principle of national treatment under TRIPS ensures that foreign IP rights holders receive the same level of 
      protection and treatment as domestic rights holders within member countries. This provision promotes fair and non-discriminatory 
      treatment, preventing any form of preferential treatment for domestic IP rights holders.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Patent Protection:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      TRIPS mandates that patents be granted for inventions in all fields of technology, subject to specific criteria such as novelty, 
      inventive step, and industrial applicability. It establishes a minimum patent term of 20 years from the filing date, ensuring a 
      reasonable period of exclusivity for inventors to recoup their investment and incentivizing innovation. However, TRIPS also recognizes 
      that member countries can adopt certain exceptions and limitations to patent rights, such as allowing compulsory licensing in cases of national 
      emergencies or public health crises.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Copyright Protection:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      TRIPS sets out minimum standards for copyright protection, including the rights of reproduction, distribution, and public performance or display
      of copyrighted works. It requires member countries to provide copyright protection for a minimum term of 50 years after the death of the author 
      (or 50 years from publication for anonymous works). TRIPS also addresses digital copyright issues, including protection against unauthorized reproduction 
      and distribution of digital content.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Trademark Protection:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      TRIPS emphasizes the importance of trademark protection for distinctive signs that identify goods and services in the marketplace. It requires member
      countries to establish effective trademark systems, including procedures for registration, enforcement, and the provision of remedies against trademark infringement. 
      TRIPS promotes the prevention of unauthorized use of trademarks, which helps build consumer trust and fosters fair competition.
    </p>
    <P></P>
    <h4>Enforcement and Dispute Settlement:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      TRIPS recognizes the significance of effective enforcement mechanisms to combat intellectual property infringements. It requires member countries to establish
      procedures and remedies for the enforcement of IP rights, including civil and criminal penalties for infringements. TRIPS also provides a dispute settlement mechanism 
      through the WTO, enabling member countries to resolve disputes related to intellectual property issues in a transparent and fair manner.
    </p>
    <P></P>
    <h4>Flexibilities and Exceptions:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      TRIPS acknowledges that member countries may need to adopt certain flexibilities and exceptions to strike a balance between IP protection and other public policy objectives. 
      These flexibilities include compulsory licensing, which allows governments to authorize the use or production of a patented invention without the consent of the patent holder, 
      under specific circumstances such as public health emergencies or to address anticompetitive practices. TRIPS also permits member countries to adopt measures to prevent the abuse
      of IP rights that may impede competition.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Public Health and Access to Medicines:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      One of the critical areas addressed by TRIPS is public health. It recognizes the importance of access to affordable medicines, particularly in developing and least-developed countries. 
      TRIPS allows member countries to use various measures to protect public health and promote access to medicines, including the use of compulsory licensing, the parallel importation of 
      pharmaceutical products, and the ability to grant exemptions to patent rights for the production of essential medicines.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Technology Transfer and Capacity Building:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      TRIPS encourages developed countries to provide technical and financial assistance to developing and least-developed countries to enhance their capacity in the field of intellectual 
      property rights protection and enforcement. This assistance aims to bridge the technological and knowledge gap between nations, promoting technology transfer, and facilitating the development 
      of domestic innovation and creativity.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Overall, TRIPS plays a vital role in promoting and protecting intellectual property rights globally. By establishing minimum standards, harmonizing laws, and providing flexibility, 
      it seeks to strike a balance between incentivizing innovation, promoting access to essential goods and services, and addressing the specific needs of different countries. TRIPS aims 
      to create a robust and balanced intellectual property framework that fosters economic growth, technological advancement, and the dissemination of knowledge worldwide.

    <h3>BERNE CONVENTION </h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, often referred to as the Berne Convention, is an international agreement that establishes the minimum standards for copyright 
      protection among its member countries.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Background:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The Berne Convention was first adopted in 1886 in Berne, Switzerland, and has undergone several revisions since then. It aims to provide creators of literary, artistic, and intellectual works with 
      a standardized framework for copyright protection and to facilitate international recognition and enforcement of their rights.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Scope of Protection:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The Convention covers various types of creative works, including but not limited to:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Literary works (such as novels, poems, and plays)</li>
      <li>Musical compositions</li>
      <li>Artistic works (such as paintings, sculptures, and photographs)</li>
      <li>Films and audiovisual works</li>
      <li>Architectural designs</li>
      <li>Computer programs</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Introduction:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, adopted in 1886, stands as a milestone in international copyright law. With its primary objective of providing 
      a standardized framework for copyright protection, the Berne Convention has fostered global cooperation and ensured the rights of creators are recognized and respected. This article delves into the 
      key provisions and significance of the Convention, shedding light on its impact on the protection and promotion of creativity worldwide.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>National Treatment and Minimum Standards:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      At the core of the Berne Convention lies the principle of national treatment, ensuring that creators from member countries are accorded the same copyright protection as their own citizens receive. 
      By eliminating discriminatory practices based on nationality, the Convention promotes fairness and equal opportunities for creators worldwide.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The Convention also establishes minimum standards for copyright protection, acting as a foundation for member countries’ copyright laws. While countries have the flexibility to adopt more extensive protection, 
      the Berne Convention sets the baseline, ensuring that creators are granted essential rights and safeguards regardless of their origin.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Automatic Protection and Copyright Formalities:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>The Berne Convention provides creators with the advantage of automatic protection, rendering copyright protection inherent as soon as a work is created. This eliminates the need for formalities such as registration 
       or copyright notices, streamlining the process and reducing administrative burdens for authors.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The elimination of copyright formalities also simplifies international copyright protection. Creators no longer face disparate registration or deposit requirements when seeking protection in different member countries. 
      This harmonization facilitates the global recognition and enforcement of copyright, promoting cross-border collaborations and the dissemination of creative works.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Copyright Duration and Term Extension:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The Berne Convention sets a minimum duration for copyright protection, ensuring that creators and their heirs benefit economically from their works. The minimum term stipulates that copyright lasts for the lifetime of the 
      author plus an additional period of 50 years after their death.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      However, countries have the freedom to extend copyright terms beyond the Convention’s minimum requirements. Many jurisdictions, including the European Union, have extended the duration to 70 years after the author’s death for most works. 
      These extensions provide longer protection and incentivize creativity, allowing authors and their families to enjoy economic benefits for an extended period.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Exclusive Rights and Limitations:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The Berne Convention grants creators exclusive rights over their works, enabling them to control and monetize their creations. These rights encompass reproduction, distribution, public performance, adaptation, and translation, empowering authors 
      to exercise control over the exploitation of their intellectual endeavours.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      To strike a balance between the rights of creators and public interests, the Convention acknowledges the necessity for limitations and exceptions to copyright. Member countries can implement reasonable limitations and exceptions, 
      such as fair use/fair dealing, educational use, or public interest considerations. These provisions foster innovation, education, and access to knowledge while upholding the core principles of copyright protection.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Moral Rights and Authorship Attribution:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      In addition to economic rights, the Berne Convention recognizes moral rights, which safeguard the non-economic interests and reputation of authors. Moral rights encompass two fundamental aspects: the right to be identified as the author of a work 
      and the right to object to any modifications or distortions that may harm the author’s reputation.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
       Moral rights are typically perpetual and non-transferable, enabling authors to maintain control over the integrity and authenticity of their works. By preserving the link between creators and their creations, moral rights ensure that authors’ 
       artistic vision and reputation are safeguarded, even if economic rights are transferred or expired.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Enforcement and International Cooperation:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      To ensure the effective enforcement of copyright, the Berne Convention obligates member countries to establish mechanisms for combating copyright infringements. These mechanisms encompass civil remedies, such as injunctions and damages, as well as criminal 
      penalties for severe infringements.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the Convention promotes international cooperation and information exchange among member countries. The principle of reciprocity requires countries to provide each other with the same level of protection and enforcement they grant to their own citizens. 
      Organizations like the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) facilitate this cooperation, assisting countries in implementing and enforcing copyright laws and addressing the challenges posed by the digital age.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The Berne Convention stands as a crucial international agreement that has shaped the landscape of copyright protection and fostered global collaboration in the creative industries. By establishing national treatment, minimum standards, and automatic protection, 
      the Convention ensures that creators' rights are upheld and that their works are recognized and respected internationally. With its emphasis on exclusivity, moral rights, and enforcement, the Berne Convention continues to play a vital role in nurturing creativity, 
      encouraging innovation, and safeguarding the interests of authors in an increasingly interconnected world.

    <h3>PARIS CONVENTION</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      One of the first and most important international treaties protecting intellectual property rights is the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, which was created in 1883. A more unified and organised international system for the protection of inventions, trademarks, and industrial designs was fostered by this agreement, which was a trailblazing step in realising the necessity for uniform intellectual property protection across national borders.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      One of its main points is that if you are a citizen of one nation and you create something innovative, such as a novel device or an iconic brand name, you should be entitled to the same protections abroad as you would at home. This puts an end to prejudice or unjust treatment of individuals from different backgrounds.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Three main components serve as the foundation for the Paris Convention’s goals and principles:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>National Treatment: The idea of national treatment is one of the Convention’s core tenets. It requires that, with regard to intellectual property rights, each member nation treat the citizens of other member nations no less favourably than it treats its own citizens. This implies that, in each member nation, foreign inventors, artists, and intellectual property owners need to be accorded the same legal treatment as citizens.</li>
      <li>Right of Priority: The Convention established the notion of the “right of priority,” which grants a petitioner the ability to submit an application for protection in another member nation within a given time frame without losing their initial filing date. An innovator, for example, may submit for patent or trademark protection in one member nation and then, within a certain period of time (usually 6 to 12 months), file for protection in other member countries, keeping the original filing date. This is helpful since it frees the innovator to investigate different markets without worrying about losing their patent rights through further applications.</li>
      <li>Common Rules and Standards: Among its member nations, the Convention seeks to standardise a number of laws and regulations pertaining to trade names, industrial designs, patents, trademarks, and other areas of intellectual property rights. A worldwide uniform and predictable framework for intellectual property protection is made possible by this standardisation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which is overseen by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and other regional accords have been impacted by and built upon by the Paris Convention. It has made a major contribution to the global development of a more thorough and organised approach to intellectual property rights. 
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The goals and rules of the treaty have established a solid framework for global collaboration and comprehension in the field of intellectual property rights. It has prompted nations to collaborate in order to create legal frameworks and procedures that provide stronger protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, therefore assisting artists and inventors and promoting creativity and innovation on a worldwide scale.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      It’s crucial to remember that, even while the Paris Convention establishes basic criteria, individual member nations may have additional rules and regulations pertaining to intellectual property that go above and beyond the Convention’s baseline requirements. As a result, the treaty provides a general framework but allows individual nations to opt to impose stricter safeguards if they so want.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      All in all, it functions as a kind of global consensus that safeguards innovative concepts and discoveries while advancing equity and inspiring individuals to continue doing amazing things.

    <h3>UNIVERSAL COPYRIGHT CONVENTION</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Under the direction of UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation), an international agreement known as the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC) was created in 1952. The UCC’s principal goal is to further the worldwide protection of authors’ rights over their creative, artistic, and scientific works.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The UCC’s main goal is to safeguard the rights of creators, including writers, painters, musicians, and other creative people, by making sure that their creations are valued and safeguarded globally. It encourages global collaboration for the safeguarding of creative works.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>National Treatment: The UCC is based on the concept of national treatment, just as other international treaties such as the Paris Convention. It mandates that member nations give international artists’ works the same degree of protection as they do to their own citizens. This guarantees that authors from other member nations will receive the same treatment and won't face prejudice.</li>
      <li>Flexibility: The UCC recognises and recognises the variations in state copyright laws. Although it establishes a set of guidelines for copyright protection, it gives member nations latitude in how these guidelines are applied to account for the various degrees of protection found in various legal frameworks.</li>
      <li>Works Covered: The UCC covers a wide range of artistic, literary, and musical works in addition to translations, adaptations, and other types of intellectual property. It seeks to safeguard different kinds of artistic expression.</li>
      <li>Copyright Symbol: To signify copyright protection, the UCC established the globally recognised copyright symbol “©”. This icon shows that a work is covered by copyright laws and supports artists in asserting their legal rights.</li>
      <li>Relation to the Berne Convention: The UCC provides a significant international instrument for copyright protection as an alternative to the Berne Convention. The UCC, in contrast, allows greater freedom and could be more appropriate in some nations, particularly those with distinct copyright laws, while the Berne Convention offers more extensive and stringent regulations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The UCC has significantly influenced how intellectual property rights are protected internationally. It has given copyright protection a standardised method, especially for nations with differing copyright laws or those not party to the Berne Convention. It has aided in the international recognition and protection of artists' rights and the transnational flow of creative works by creating shared values and norms.

    <h1>IPR DOCTRINES</h1>
    <p></p>
    <h4>DOCTRINE OF TACKING</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      As long as a trademark is retained by its owner or an authorized user, it is granted the sole right to use it under trademark law. To adapt their trademarks to the demands of culture and society, owners may decide to improve or alter them. It should be remembered, 
      nevertheless, that any alteration to the original mark has a substantial impact on the nature of rights exercised. As long as the mark is being used for commercial purposes, the trademark owner has the exclusive right to use it and may prohibit any succeeding owners 
      from using marks that are identical to the registered trademark, which is likely to cause consumer confusion. The mark is deemed abandoned and returned to the public domain when there is no intention to resume usage. By virtue of this, marks of such nature are available 
      for use by others to indicate the origin of their goods and services. 
    </p> 
    <p></p>
    <p>
      This notion bridges the gap between the original trademark and reasonable upgradations through time since, in most cases, the owner abandons the rights associated with a trademark when the use of the trademark ceases. The tacking on notion tends to prevent the abandonment problem. 
      The fundamental component of tacking is whether the renewed trademark maintains the same commercial image. To apply the tacking theory, both the original and modified trademark must commercially communicate the same image to the customers; the consumers must consider both trademarks to be the same. 
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      In the absence of such a Doctrine, proprietors will be hindered from making modifications to their marks in order to prevent them from developing visually and from employing new advertising and marketing approaches that may be used by new entrants. It is not to enable the expansion and evergreening of both varieties. 
      To take advantage of the initial use of the original trademark, which must be amended later to be in line with current market conditions, the applicant would file an application for the amended trademark, citing their earlier use of a similar trademark. 
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The “tacking-on”of a trademark is a legal technicality that permits a trademark owner to make minor changes without losing ownership of the original trademark. Tacking as a legal principle is not common in India, although it is widely used.
      An applicant can claim trademark use from the date he began using the trademark for the first time, even if the look of the first trademark differs from what is subsequently sought.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, a trademark is updated throughout time to keep up with the current market conditions, but the use of the same is claimed from the moment the trademark is initially used in its basic form. 
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      In Sengoku Works Ltd. v. RMC International Ltd, 96 F.3d 1217,( 9 th circuit.1996) the court opined that the doctrine helps the proprietor of an old mark to avail the same rights concerning the new mark while enabling the consumers to identify the source of the mark and disabling the appropriation of both marks by competitors. 
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      In Jack Wolfson Ausrustung v. New Millennium Sports,116 USPQ2d 1129 (Fed. Cir. 2015). In this case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit dealt with the issue as a priority and held that only if an old form and the new form of the same mark are legal equivalents can tacking be permitted.
      In this case, the prior mark was ‘KELME,’ which was immaterially altered by utilizing a different font style while retaining the letters ‘KELME.’ 
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      In Brookfield Communications,Inc.v.West Coast Entertainment Corporation, 174 F.3d at 1036, the standard to be considered for tacking purposes has been set as exceedingly strict and narrow.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>DOCTRINE OF FUNCTIONALITY</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The functionality doctrine is a rule in trademark law which states that 
      functional product features cannot serve as a trademark. A product feature is 
      considered functional if it is essential to the use or purpose of the product or if it 
      affects the cost or quality of the product. It prohibits registration of functional 
      product features and is intended to encourage legitimate competition by 
      maintaining a proper balance between trademark law and patent law. 
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Valu Engineering, Inc. v. Rexnord Corp., 278 F.3d 1268 (Fed. Cir. 2002): The 
      court decided that certain conveyor belt shapes were functional due to their 
      increased performance over alternative designs and were therefore not eligible 
      to be considered a trademark.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Prods. Co, 514 U.S. 159 : The supreme court 
      explained that the functionality doctrine seeks to promote legitimate 
      competition by allowing a producer to control a useful product feature. It is the 
      province of patent law, not trademark law, to encourage invention by granting 
      inventors a monopoly over new product designs or functions for a limited time. 
      If a product’s functional features could be used as trademarks, however, a 
      monopoly over such features could be obtained without regard to whether they 
      qualify as patents and could be extended forever (because trademarks may be 
      renewed in perpetuity). 
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      In Traffix Devices, Inc. v. Mktg. Displays, Inc., 532 U.S. 23 (2001), the 
      Supreme Court reiterated this rationale, also noting that the functionality 
      doctrine is not affected by evidence of acquired distinctiveness. Thus, even 
      when the evidence establishes that consumers have come to associate a 
      functional product feature with a single source, trademark protection will not be 
      granted in light of the public policy reasons stated.
    </p>
    <br></br>
    <h4>DOCTRINE OF AESTHETIC FUNCTIONALITY</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      When goods are bought largely for their aesthetic value, their features may be 
      functional because they definitely contribute to that value and thus aid the 
      performance of an object for which the goods are intended. The doctrine has 
      since evolved to deny trademark protection to design features that make a 
      product more aesthetically pleasing or commercially desirable, serve no sourceidentifying function, 
      and are necessary for competition.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Aesthetic functionality has also been used, in certain circumstances, to foreclose 
      liability for infringement for uses of designs that are merely aesthetically 
      functional and not source-identifying The doctrine of aesthetic functionality is 
      applied when protection would put competitors at a significant non-reputationrelated 
      disadvantage if they were precluded from using the same feature.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      A trademark is aesthetically functional, and therefore ineligible for protection 
      when protection of the mark significantly undermines competitor’s ability to 
      compete in the relevant market. The “functionality doctrine” prevents product 
      manufacturers from protecting specific features of a product using trademark 
      law. (Functionality can be protected under patent law, but not under trademark 
      law.)
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Courts will consider the following factors when determining utilitarian 
      functionality: 
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Whether a feature is essential to the use or purpose of the product </li>
      <li>Whether a feature affects the cost or quality of the product </li>
      <li>Whether granting of trademark for the exclusive use of the feature would put 
          competitors at a significant non-reputation-related disadvantage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      LTTB LLC v. Redbubble, Inc. (9th Cir. Jan. 20, 2021) In this case, the U.S. 
      District Court held that the defendant’s use of a trademarked phrase on a shirt 
      was aesthetically functional because consumers liked the pun in the phrase, not 
      the trademarked source, so no infringement occurred.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <br></br>
    <h4>TERRITORIALITY DOCTRINE</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The Territoriality principle stipulates that the intellectual property rights do not 
      extend beyond the territory of the sovereign state which had granted the rights 
      in the first place. It favors the notion that the reputation of a product or service 
      is limited to the territory of the country in which that trademark was granted the 
      status of a well-known trademark. 
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      It means that a well-known trademark can only be considered so within the 
      nation’s territory as its reputation is limited that way. The principle of 
      territoriality permits states to tailor their national intellectual property laws to 
      suit their level of technological and economic development. In other words, 
      pursuant to the principle of territoriality, countries can design their intellectual 
      property laws in a manner that facilitates the achievement of specific societal 
      goals.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      In Jones Investment Co. v.Vishnupriya Hosiery Mills (Order 24/2014) IPAB 
      :The IPAB chose to rule against the complainants, pointing out that since the 
      said complainant (a foreign MNC) had no intentions of expanding their business 
      in India and launching their products into the Indian market, an Indian company 
      could not be halted from using trademarks that were allegedly similar. The 
      ruling was based on the ground that the countries where Jones Investment Co. 
      was based or conducted its business were the only ones that could possibly 
      consider that the said company’s trademark was well-known amongst the 
      consumers in the country.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>UNIVERSALITY DOCTRINE</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      According to the Universality doctrine, once a trademark is recognized or registered in one country, it gains universal recognition. It favors trans-border reputation and is an exception to the Territoriality doctrine. This means that if a trademark enjoys the status of a well-known trademark in the United States of America, it would enjoy the same status with regard to its goods or services in India as well, or any other country for that matter.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      This principle respects the concept of the trans-border reputation of a brand. It is often considered as an exception to the aforementioned territoriality principle. 
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The possibility of a brand having a universal reputation is not ignored when courts choose to apply this principle to a case. 
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Milmet Oftho Industries & Ors v. Allergan Inc 2004 (28) PTC 585 SC
      The Supreme Court, after establishing the trans-border reputation of the Respondents stated that the mere fact that the Respondents have not been using the mark in India would be irrelevant if they were first in the world market.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>RISE OF TERRITORIALITY OVER UNIVERSALITY</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The Indian courts have recognised backed both principles. This raises an important issue of whether well-known trademarks should be governed by the territoriality doctrine or the universality theory.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The territoriality concept is favoured by judicial and academic opinion throughout the world because it protects domestic traders from huge international firms situated in other nations. The widely held belief is that a firm claiming the status of a “well-known” trademark in a jurisdiction must also have a reputation in that territory.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The Universality concept contends that the recognition and reputation of a trademark are not dependent on the sale of products carrying the mark in question. Advertising and promoting the mark through various types of media is sufficient to build reputation and goodwill within a certain geographical region. However, this view contradicts the equality principle since, in order to compare two objects, they must first be equals. As a result, if a business has not released its product or has no consumers or a reputation in a given market, it cannot be compared to a corporation that has an existing product as well as a consumer base in that area.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Starbucks vs. British Sky Broadcasting [2015] UKSC 31
      The Apex court of U.K held that, no trader can complain of passing-off as against him in any territory in which he has no customers and nobody who is in trade relation with him.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Toyota Jidosha Kabushiki Kaisha V. M/S Prius Auto Industries Limited 2018 (73) PTC 1: The supreme court held that it must be assessed if there has been an overflow of the reputation and goodwill of the mark utilized by the claimant who has launched the passing off action in the country in the issue. The Hon'ble Supreme Court's ruling establishes a new standard for examining evidence to claim trans-border repute in India. As a result, the trademark must be recognized and have a separate existence in each sovereign country. After reviewing the jurisprudence on trans-border reputation in the United Kingdom and Australia, the Supreme Court concluded that the problem of trans-border reputation would be controlled by the territoriality concept in India.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The current legal position in India on trans-border reputation is that, while the concept is recognized and the presence of an actual business establishment is not required for establishing a trans-border reputation, the existence or non-existence of trans-border reputation is a question of fact. Evidence supporting the claim must be explosive or ground-breaking. The spread of reputation can occur via the internet, advertisement, or any other method that gives inhabitants of a country with adequate knowledge about a brand and its products.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>DOCTRINE OF FIRST SALE</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The concept of first sale, in essence, limits the power of distribution of copyright owners. 
      It is predicated on the premise that once a copyright owner has relinquished title to a specific copy embodying his work, subsequent possessors of the copy should not be forced to negotiate with the owner each time they consider a further sale or other transfer. When an author, for example, sells a copy of her book, the property that is transferred is not her copyright in the book, but rather the property rights in that specific physical copy of the book. As a result, the customer is not permitted to replicate the book but is permitted to resell it, as selling is an essential component of the business.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Under the first sale doctrine ownership of physical copy of copyrighted work permits the owner of the item to lend, resell and give away and destroy the copyrighted item, but the owner is not granted the right to copy the item in its entirety. That is because the transfer of physical copy does not include transfer of copyrighted work. The legal principles apply to physical items as well as digital content that is downloaded over the internet.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The first sale doctrine allows the purchaser to transfer a purchaser to transfer a particular legally acquired copy of protected work without permission once it has been obtained. That means the distribution right of copyrighted holder end on that particular copy once it has been sold.
      The first sale doctrine prohibits renting and leasing recorded music and computer software although private non-profit archives and libraries are allowed to lend these items provided they include a copyright notice on the copy. According to the copyright Act consumers cannot make copies of computer program contrary to license but resell what is owned.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      John Wiley and Sons Inc. and others v. Prabhat Chander Kumar Jain and ors (2010) PTC :In this case, the defendants were selling low-price editions of the Plaintiff’s books all over the world through their websites, while low-price editions were meant for sale only in certain territories. 
      The defendants argued that since low-priced editions were purchased in India in accordance with the law and thereafter exported, no infringement is committed within the meaning of the copyright act. The court observed that the doctrine will not apply because there was a licensing agreement between the plaintiffs and their licensees. The doctrine of first sale would not affect the copyright owners though it may partially exhaust the rights of the exclusive licensee. The court held the doctrine applies only with respect to the exclusive licensees and not the owners. Hence, there is an infringement of the copyright owner.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>DOCTRINE OF PRIOR USE</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The owner of the registered trade mark has been given an exclusive invaluable right including the use of the said trade mark to the exclusion of others. However, this exclusive right to use the trade mark is not an absolute right in favour of the registered trade mark owner. The registration of a trade mark is subject to opposition by the opponent on various grounds enumerated under the Act either prior to registration or post grant of registration. An application for the registration of the trade mark shall be denied if the trade mark would fall under grounds of rejection mentioned under sections 9 and 11 of the trademarks act of 1999. This is subject to the exception when the mark has acquired distinctiveness because of its use prior to registration or if the mark is otherwise a well-known trade mark. There are several safeguards that have been given under the Act to safeguard the interest of unregistered trade mark users. Even if the proprietor owns the unregistered trade mark, the seminal theme of the Act is based on the “first user of the trade mark”.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      It is a well-accepted judicial principle that the rights of a prior user of the mark are kept on a higher pedestal than even that of the proprietor of a registered trademark. Prior user’s rights will override those of a subsequent user even though the subsequent user had been accorded registration of its trademark.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      According to Section 34 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 “the proprietor of a registered trademark or a registered user cannot interfere with the use of any identical or similar mark if the person has been using the mark from an earlier date”. The section provides for protecting the vested rights preventing a proprietor or registered user of a trademark from interfering with the honest use of an identical trademark or a mark nearly resembling the registered mark.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h5>FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENTS OF PRIOR USE:</h5>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      (1) The use of a mark identical or nearly resembling the registered mark, by a third person, must be in relation to the goods and services for which the first-mentioned mark is registered                                                                                       
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) The use must be a continuous use of the trademark in India                                     
    </p>
    <p>
      (3) The trademark must be used by the proprietor in order to avail the protection       
    </p>
    <p>
      (4) The mark must have been used from a date prior to the use of the registered trademark or the date of registration whichever is earlier.
    </p>

      Kamat Hotels (India) Ltd. and Royal Orchid Hotels Ltd.(2018) 1 SCC 728                 The court reaffirmed the principles of prior use. The following requirements need to be met in order for prior usage to be considered against a trademark that has been registered in India:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      (1) The trademark and the subsequently registered mark may be identical or similar.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) The trademark must be applied to the same category of goods as the mark that was subsequently registered. If it falls under a different category, further rules would need to be applied, such as the need that the mark be well-known in India and that its use be harmful to the prior user’s goodwill.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3) The prior use must involve a brand registered on Indian territory. A trademark registered in India cannot be invalidated by prior usage in other countries
    </p>
    <p>
      (4) The trademark must be used consistently. In other words, it shouldn’t be a short-term use. It is crucial that the trademark has some reputation and link with the owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5) The trademark must have been in use prior to the date of registration or the usage of the trademark whose registration is being challenged.

    <h4>DOCTRINE OF EXHAUSTION</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The doctrine of Exhaustion implies that once a valid transaction of sale takes place then the owner of the intellectual property in question cannot control or prevent the further sale of the goods bearing the said intellectual property. A trademark right is often exhausted by the first sale of a product or its placement in the market. The underlying idea is that after the right holder has obtained an economic return from the initial sale or placement in the market, the purchaser or transferee of the products or services is free to use or dispose of it. The distribution right is linked to exhaustion of right. The right to distribute objects denotes the release of such things by or with the permission of the owner as a result of ownership transfer.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>NATIONAL EXHAUSTION:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      One of the constraints of intellectual property rights is national exhaustion of rights. Once a product covered by an IP right has been marketed, either by the manufacturer or by others with his permission, the manufacturer’s commercial exploitation IP rights over that product are exhausted. Any proper use of the products after the initial sale would not constitute infringement. The idea of national exhaustion does not allow the IP owner to exercise commercial control over items placed on the domestic market by the IP owner or with his consent. However, the IP owner (or his authorised licensee) may still object to the importation of original items marketed in other countries based on the IP.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>REGIONAL EXHAUSTION:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The first sale of the IP protected product by the IP owner or with his consent exhausts any IP rights over these given products not only domestically, but also within the entire region, and parallel imports within the region can no longer be opposed based on the IP right.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>INTERNATIONAL EXHAUSTION:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Once a product is exported to a market outside of India, further sales of the same product there fall under the purview of international exhaustion of rights; however, if the goods are purchased from the international market and sent back to India for the purpose of selling them here, parallel imports are not permitted.

    <h4>DOCTRINE OF SWEAT OF THE BROW</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      According to this doctrine, an author gains his right of copyright through simple diligence during the creation of a work, such as a directory or a database. Substantial creativity or originality is not required. The doctrine protects factual compilations.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The rationale behind this doctrine was to award the person who expended his sweat and effort in compiling the facts. No one can misuse and take a gain out of it. 
      The principle of Sweat of the brow doctrine can also be stated in the form that one is not at liberty to avail himself of the labour which the other has been at for the purposes of producing his work that is, in fact, merely to take away the result of another man’s intellectual property. But Copyright Act protects original and creative works. And thus this doctrine is in conflict with the core principle of the Copyright Act. It has led to confusion in order to determine the boundaries of the concept of originality.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of copyright law is to promote and protect creative works. The progress of science and arts is promoted by protecting the work of author.
      In general rule, compilations of facts are copyrightable, but facts are not. In due course of time, there developed a doctrine of “Sweat of The Brow”. This doctrine made the requirement of the creativity, in works, irrelevant. It protected the labour and sweat of the compiler, without the use of his vision and aptitude. Merely mechanical and automatic task which is not having any creativity is also copyrightable.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The Delhi High Court in the case of Diljeet Titus & Ors v Alfred  Adebare & Ors. 2006 (32) PTC 609 (Del),dealt with this matter, related to the database protection, and held that the copyright in a database prepared by an advocate working under and in the office of another advocate by using the latter’s resources, expertise and investment, would vest in the employer advocate.
      This High Court has further said that, in case of compilation, a person can make a similar compilation but cannot infringe upon the copyright of the previous compiler by appropriating the fruits of his labour. Protection is extended in the form of modicum of creativity in the selection, arrangement or coordination of the contents of a database to attract copyright protection.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      A sui generis right is required to be given to the creator of database if some creativity is involved in the making of the work. This right can only be given to the creator of the database who must show that there has been qualitatively and/or quantitatively a substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents. This is purely a “sweat of the brow” protection regime.

      In University of London Press Ltd v. University Tutorial Press Ltd, [1916] 2 Ch. 601 it was held only that the work should not be copied and must have originated from the author. It need not necessarily be novel in nature. Originality need not be seen in original or inventive thought or ideas, but in expression of such in print or writing.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The court in this case elaborated that the word “original” did not mean that the work must be the expression of original or inventive thought. It commented that Copyright Acts are concerned with the expression of thought in print or writing in the case of literary work, and not with the originality of ideas therein. The requirement of originality relates to the expression of the thought. However, the Acts do not require that the appearance must be in an original or novel form, but that the work must not be copied from another work; meaning only that it should originate from the author.
    </p>

      India strongly followed the doctrine of sweat of the brow for a considerably long time. In Kartar Singh Giani v. Ladha Singh, Air 1934 Lahore 777 the supreme court of India, following the approach of English courts, observed that copyright law does not prevent a person from taking what is useful from an original work with additions and improvements.
    </P>

    <h4>DOCTRINE OF MODICUM OF CREATIVITY</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Originality is the basic yardstick used by the copyright regimes in the world to evaluate the availability copyright protection to a particular work. The word “Originality” in civil law countries consider as an author's own intellectual creation. Through originality doctrine, copyright is safeguarding the public domain so that a person cannot claim for an expression. Section 13(1) of the Indian Copyright Act 1957 states that copyright subsists in “original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works”. However, the Act fails to give any definition or test to determine originality of a work. This leaves the court with the duty to decide the amount originality required for a work to claim copyright protection.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The courts have given importance to both the creative and subjective contribution of the authors since the late 17th century. In Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural telephone Service Co. 499 U.S. 340, the US Supreme held that in order to be original a work must not only have been the product of independent creation, but it must also exhibit a “modicum of creativity”. This doctrine stipulates that originality subsists in a work where a sufficient amount of intellectual creativity and judgment has gone into the creation of that work.
      The standard of creativity need not be high but a minimum level of creativity should be there for copyright protection. The court held that facts like names, addresses etc are not copyrightable, but compilations of facts are copyrightable. This is majorly owing to the unique way of expression by way of arrangement and if it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity, it will be copyrightable. The Court held that Rural's directory displayed a lack of requisite standards for copyright protection as it was just a compilation of data without any minimum creativity, which was a requirement for copyright protection. Hence, Rural's case was dismissed.

    <p>
      In Eastern Book Company v. D.B. Modak, Civil Appeal No. 6472 of 2004, where the Supreme Court discarded the ‘Sweat of the Brow’ doctrine and shifted to a ‘Modicum of creativity’ approach as followed in the US. The dispute is relating to copyrightability of judgements. The notion of “minimum requirement of creativity” was introduced in this case. The Court granted copyright protection to the additions and contributions made by the editors of SCC. At the same the Court also held that the orders and judgments of the Courts are in public domain and everybody has a right to use and publish them and therefore no copyright can be claimed on the same.
