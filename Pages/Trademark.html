   <h2>BEYOND BLACK AND WHITE: CAN COLOR BE TRADEMARKED?</h2>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    According to Indian trademark regulations, colors can be registered as trademarks if they have gained uniqueness and are seen by consumers as being connected to a certain brand. It must be established that a color has acquired secondary significance and is closely associated with a particular item or service in order for it to be registered as a trademark.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <h4>Why should we trademark color?</h4>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    Organizations frequently try trademarking colors to establish a strong connection between a certain color and their brand. This connection aids in market distinctiveness and brand identification. Some well-known examples of color trademarks include UPS’s brown logo and Tiffany & Co.’s distinctive blue.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <h4>When colors can be trademarked?</h4>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    The applicant must present proof that the color has become distinctive via widespread usage in commerce and that consumers predominantly associate the color with the source of the products or services in order for the color to be effectively registered as a trademark.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    It’s important to remember that registering a color trademark might be difficult. The applicant must demonstrate that the color has become unique and isn’t merely a standard for the industry or a functional feature of the product. Furthermore, colors can be included in a trademark, but usually only in a larger logo or design, which makes it simpler to prove uniqueness.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    The Trademark Registry must receive an application before a trademark may be registered in India. A visual illustration of the color being claimed must be included in this application, and the applicant must be able to demonstrate the color’s uniqueness and connection to the products or services they offer.
   </p>

   <p></p>
   <h4>Section 18: Trademark Registration</h4>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    Section 18(1): The requirements for registering a trademark are covered in this section. It describes the kinds of marks that can be registered, the level of distinctiveness needed to be registered, and how to apply for registration.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    Section 18(2): The precise requirements that a mark must meet to be registered as a trademark. It states that the mark must be able to identify one person’s goods or services from those of others.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    Section 18(3): The registration of some marks that are deemed generic or descriptive, or that lack distinguishing character, is prohibited.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    These parts of the Trademarks Act, among other laws, would be pertinent in demonstrating the distinctiveness and potential for a color to serve as a trademark while evaluating the registration of a color as a trademark in India. For a color to be eligible for registration, it must have developed a secondary meaning or uniqueness that links it to the particular products or services.

   <h1>TESTS FOR TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT:-</h1>
   <p></p>
    <h4>1. LAPP TEST:-</h4>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    A standard test used to determine the “likelihood of confusion”. 
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    Originated in Polaroid Corporation v. Polarad electronics corporation 287 F.2d 492 (2d Cir.1961)
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    Judge Friendly laid down the multifactor test for the likelihood of confusion. The Lapp test is a non-exhaustive list of factors relevant to assessing the likelihood of confusion. Not all factors will be relevant in all cases, and the different factors may properly be accorded different weights depending on the circumstances of each particular case.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    No single factor is dispositive and a finding of a likelihood of confusion does not require a positive finding on a majority of the factors listed.

   <h4>DRAWBACKS IN THE MULTIFACTOR / LAPP TEST:</h4>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    The open-ended nature of the test creates legal uncertainty and generates high litigation costs. The vague and open-ended nature of the test makes success hard to predict even for legitimate trademark owners. The dependence of the test on case-specific facts makes litigation costly. The combination of uncertainty and high litigation costs creates an environment conducive to weak assertions of trademark rights.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    The lack of a clear supporting rationale to limit its scope leads the test to be susceptible to broad interpretations. The broad interpretations given by the court risk high social costs without clear trademark-related benefits.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    In Interpace Corp. v. Lapp, Inc., 721 F.2d 460, 463 (3d Cir. 1983)
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>
    In this case, the district court fashioned its own multifactor test that approximates but does not completely match the Lapp test. Ten factors were introduced to the Lapp test to determine the likelihood of confusion for direct confusion claims between goods that do not directly compete in the same market. The likelihood of confusion for both competing and non-competing goods is tested with reference to the following factors. It is emphasized that the factors should be utilized in accordance with the given situation. The court observed that in addition to the listed factors, any other relevant factor can be considered to determine whether the likelihood of confusion exists.

    Sumeet Research and Holdings v. Sipra Appliances CS (COMM) 428/2016 and I.A. 13428/2015  
 </p>
 <p></p>
 <p>
    In this case, the High Court of Delhi relied upon the triple identity test and observed that where the defendant has made use of an identical or deceptively similar trademark in relation to identical goods having an identical trade channel, the balance of convenience would tilt in favor of the plaintiff. 
 </p>
 <p></p>
 <p>
    Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd AIR 1960 SC 142
 </p>
 <p></p>
 <p>
    The court applied the triple identity test and opined that the absolute identity of competing marks or their close resemblance is only one of the tests for determining the question of the likelihood of deception and confusion. Trade connection between different goods is another such test.  Therefore, a mark identical or similar to a registered trademark can be used or registered for goods/ services falling within the same class as the registered trademark.
 </p>
 <p></p>
 <h4>4. DOMINANCY TEST:</h4>
 <p></p>
 <p>
    Originated in Taiwan Colin Corporation Ltd. V. Kolin Electronics Co. Inc
</p>
<p></p>
<p>        T
    The dominancy test focuses on the similarity of the prevalent or dominant features of the competing trademarks that might cause confusion, mistake, and deception in the minds of the purchasing public.
 </p>
 <p></p>
 <p>
    Mc Donalds Corporation v. Big Mak Burger Inc, G.R No. 143993, Aug 18 2004                          
 </p>
 <p></p>
 <p>
    In this case it was observed that under the dominancy test, the dominant features of the competing marks are considered in determining whether these competing marks are confusingly similar. Greater weight is given to the similarity of the appearance of the products arising from the adoption of the dominant features of the registered mark, disregarding minor differences. The visual, aural, connotative, and overall comparisons and impressions engendered by the marks in controversy as they are encountered in the realities of the marketplace are the main considerations
 </p>

    Co Tiong Sa v. Director of Patents G.R No. L-5378- 95 Phil                                                       
 </p>
 <p></p>
 <p>
    In this case the court relied on the dominancy test to determine the question of infringement of a trademark. The court opined that the differences of variations in the details of one trademark and of another are not legally accepted tests of similarity in trademarks. If the competing trademark contains the main, essential, or dominant features of another, and confusion is likely to result, then infringement is said to have taken place.

 <p>
    Dermaline Inc v. Myra Pharmaceuticals Inc., G.R No. 190065, 16 August 2010

<h4>5.HOLISTIC TEST:-</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
    Originated in Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co 514 U.S. 159 (1995)   
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    The United States Supreme Court introduced the concept of holistic or overall impression test to determine trademark infringement, emphasizing that the evaluation should consider the total effect of the marks rather than focussing on individual elements in isolation                                                                                                                      
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    The holistic test requires that the entirety of the marks in question be considered in resolving confusing similarities of competing trademarks. The holistic test considers the mark as a whole in determining confusing similarity among the trademarks.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    Luft Co. Inc v. Ngo Guan, 18 SCRA 944 (1996)                                                        
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    Under the holistic test, the marks are considered as a whole. An essential factor in determining whether two trademarks are confusingly similar is whether or not there is a general similarity in their appearance. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    Etepha v. Director of Patents, G.R. No. L-20635, 31 March 1996                                                                               
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    The test requires a comparison of the marks in their entirety as they appear in their respective labels and in relation to the goods to which they are attached since the discerning eye of the observer must focus not only on the predominant words but also on the other features appearing on the labels. Factors such as sound; appearance; form, style, shape, size or format; colour; ideas connoted by the marks; the meaning, spelling, and pronunciation of words used; and the setting in which the words appear’ may be considered

<h4>6. AVERAGE CONSUMER TEST / TEST OF CONFUSION:-</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
    Originated in Nestle SA v. Cadbury UK Limited (Cadbury purple case)                               
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    This case was decided by the European Court of Justice in 2015. The ECJ established that while assessing the distinctiveness of a trademark, the perception of the average consumer is the key factor.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    The Average Consumer is understood to be “reasonably well informed” and, rather than making a direct comparison between the products, he/she relies on the imperfect picture of the products that he/she has stored in mind. The general standard is that of the eventual target purchaser who will not make a careful examination of rival products and marks. In a trademark infringement suit, this standard is quite subjective in nature as the similarity of rival marks may vary from customer to customer. While a fixed standard or rule is difficult to define, the Courts view two rival trademarks from the perspective of a consumer with average intelligence and imperfect recollection. The Average Consumer test has stood against the test of time and has been explicated by several Courts in different jurisdictions. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    James Chadwick & Bros. Ltd. V. The National Sewing Thread Co AIR 1957 BOM 147                                                                                                                       
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    This case was one of the initial cases in India which elucidated the average consumer test. In this case, a division bench of the Bombay High Court observed that a man looking at a trademark would not take in every single feature of the trademark. The question pertains to what he would normally retain in his mind after looking at the trademark. It relates to the salient features of the trademark which in the future would lead him to associate the particular goods with that trademark.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    Cadila Healthcare Ltd. V. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd 2001 (2) PTC 541 SC
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    In this case the supreme court of India expounded the average consumer test from the perspective of an average Indian consumer. The court noted that in a country like India where there is no common language, an important test to be applied is whether the similarity between the two marks is such that it is likely to cause confusion in the mind of an ordinary consumer. In this case, the supreme court has also laid down factors to be considered from the perspective of an average Indian consumer.

<h4>7. TEST OF PHONETIC SIMILARITY:-</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
    Originated in Rogers v. Richmond 365 U.S 534 (1961)                                             
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    The provision dealing with infringement of a registered mark as a result of phonetic similarity is incorporated under Section 29(9) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 which states that a mark may be infringed by the spoken use as well as visual representation of words. The Supreme Court has on several occasions affirmed that comparison of trademarks must be done with reference to both ear as well as the eye.

</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    Phonetic similarity as one of the fundamental tests of comparison was cemented in this landmark case. The supreme court opined that the principle of phonetic similarity can be used when the manner in which the conflicting words are written is different.
</p>

<h4>8. TEST OF DECEPTIVE SIMILARITY</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
    Originated in the English case of Parker. J in the pianotist’s case (1906) 23 RPC 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    The test was postulated over a century ago and repeatedly cited by various courts in India, including the Apex Court as the definitive test to be adopted while comparing two rival trademarks.

    Parle Products (P) Ltd J.P & Co Mysore AIR 1972 SC 1359
</P>
<p></p>
<p>
    The Supreme Court stated that to conclude whether a mark is deceptively similar to another, the comprehensive and vital features of the two are to be considered. They should not be placed side by side to find out if there are any differences in the design and if so, whether they are of such character as to avoid one design from being mistaken for the other. 
</p>

<p>Cadila Healthcare Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd 2001 (2) PTC 541 SC

<h4>9.TEST OF CONCEPTUAL SIMILARITY:-</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
    The conceptual similarity test compares competing marks based on the underlying idea or concept they indicate or project. The main issue in such a test is whether or not an ordinary man of prudence might be misled or confused by two conceptually similar marks because of their similarity. Conceptual similarity is an important prong in proving deceptive similarity. It has been accepted by the courts to be the sole ground for infringement, despite differences in visual and phonetic similarities.  
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    Harry Reynolds v. Laffeaty’s Ltd [ 1958 R.P.C. 387] (The Aquamatic case) 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    In this case the court emphasised that in deciding the question of similarity between the two marks the approach must be taken from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and of imperfect recollection. To such a man the overall structural and phonetic similarity and the similarity of the idea in the two marks is reasonably likely to cause confusion between them.
</p>
<p></p>
<h4>10. ROGERS TEST:-</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
    Originated in Rogers v. Grimaldi 875.2d 994 (2d Cir. 1989)                                     
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    In this case the Court observed that the mixture of meanings, with the possibly misleading meaning not the result of explicit misstatement, precluded a claim for a false description of content. To the extent that there was a risk that the title would mislead some consumers as to what the work was about, that risk was outweighed by the danger that suppressing an artistically relevant though the ambiguous title would unduly restrict expression.    
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    The court sought to determine whether artistic expression under the First Amendment of the U.S constitution overrides the application of traditional trademark rights. If the use of the trademark in the work does not add expressive value to the work that is protectable by the First Amendment, trademark infringement might be found. In particular, the Rogers test applies the Lanham Act to an original expressive work only if the defendant’s use of the mark is not artistically relevant to the work or explicitly misleads consumers as to the source or the content of the work. Court found book titles, song titles, television show titles, video games, and parodying photographs to include artistic expression that overrode the Lanham Act's trademark protections.  
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    AM General LLC v. Activision Blizzard S.D.N.Y No. 17-8644
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    In this case the district court of Southern New York used the Rogers test to hold that the usage of realistic military vehicles in video games to stimulate the warlike environment fulfilled the artistic relevance criteria of the test. The court stated that in the tussle between likelihood of confusion and First Amendment free speech rights, the latter would outweigh the former since there was no association with the origin of symbol with the plaintiff.  
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    Brown v Entertainment Merchants Association 131 S.C.T 2729  
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    The United States Supreme Court observed that video games were expressive works and could be given protection as free speech under the First Amendment to the US constitution. The Roger’s test was extended to balance free speech and trademark protection afforded to videogames. It aims to establish whether the used trademark is artistically relevant to the defendants work and whether it is intentionally misleading.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    Tata Sons v. Greenpeace International 178(2011) DLT 705  
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    The Delhi High court was faced with a scenario where the defendants were using the registered tata trademark in their game. In balancing the commitments of the law under the freedom of speech and expression the court observed that the commercial or communicative intent of the speech would be considered. The court held that since the trademark was used as a method of critiquing Tata, it would not constitute trademark infringement.

<h1>Trademark Infringement and Passing Off</h1>
<p></p>
<p>
    In the fast-paced world of business, where companies compete with one another for consumers attention, intellectual property protection is critical. Despite being legally separate, passing off and trademark infringement both seriously jeopardise the integrity and worth of your brand. Businesses may protect their well-earned goodwill and image by being aware of these ideas and their options for response. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    The fundamental component of brand identification is undermined by trademark infringement, which denotes the improper use of trademarks or confusingly similar variations. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit clarified the eight essential components of the litmus test for infringement in AWGI, LLC v. Atlas Trucking Co., LLC (2021). These consist of the mark’s strength, the products or services relatedness, the marks likeness, proof of genuine confusion, marketing channels, buyer care, the defendant's intention, and future growth.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    When a mark significantly imitates another without permission, that is considered direct infringement; contributory acts or vicarious control are examples of indirect infringement. The dangers of comparative advertising are highlighted by recent instances like Reckitt Benckiser India Private Limited v. Hindustan Unilever Limited (2021), which have the potential to defame rival companies and result in legal action.
</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Passing Off: Upholding Unregistered Trademarks</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
    In common law nations, passing off protects unregistered trademarks by preventing deception and preserving goodwill that has been built up. The ability to show how the defendant’s acts harmed the plaintiff’s reputation and commercial interests is essential to proving a passing off claim.
</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Avenues for Redress: Exploring Remedial Measures</h4>
<p></p>
Individuals who have been wronged by trademark infringement have a variety of legal options at their disposal. 
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Obtaining injunctions to stop infringement and pursuing damages claims are examples of civil remedies. </li>
    <li>Criminal remedies, on the other hand, use harsh penalties, such as fines and jail time, to discourage serious violations. </li>
    <li>By providing administrative redress, administrative remedies enable opposition filings to correct incorrect trademark registrations.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Awareness is the core of protection in the complex world of intellectual property rights. Through the skillful interpretation of trademark infringement and passing off, companies may bolster their legal defenses and protect their trademarks from unscrupulous use. Proactive steps may protect businesses from reputational damage and maintain their market position, whether negotiating the complexities of comparative advertising or suing against obvious infringements.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    In a time of constant innovation and rivalry, protecting your brand is not just wise but necessary. Accept the fundamentals of trademark law, bolster your defenses, and set out to build a brand that will last in the dynamic marketplace.
