<h1>REGISTRATION OF PATENT</h1>
<p></p>
<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
    In a world where cutting-edge technology rules, protecting intellectual property has become critical for creators whose works are essential to their businesses. The purpose of patents is to protect technical innovations while simultaneously honoring the original inventor’s labour of love, laborious effort, patience, and special talents. 
</p>
<p></p>
<h5>The Three Main Justifications for Indian Patents: Need for registration:</h5>
<p></p>
<p>
    1. Protection and Possession (Under Section 2(1)(m) of the Indian Patent Act)
       Inventions are the foundation of corporate operations in the ever-evolving field of technology. By protecting the results of an innovator’s work from rivals in the market, patenting assures that they remain unique. The idea of proper ownership emphasizes how crucial it is to protect one’s ideas from corporate players’ tenacious pursuit.
<p></p>
<p>
    2. Possibility of Monetization (Under Section 48 of the Indian Patent Act)
       Having a patent approved allows for the creation . Among the many ways inventors might make money from their inventions are product marketing, corporate licensing, and patent sales. A patent with the right financial and strategic management may become a valuable asset.
</p>
<p>
    3. Cultivating Creativity (Under Section 10(4)(d) of the Indian Patent Act)
       In addition to acting as a barrier, the patent registration procedure stimulates innovation. This information sharing fosters an environment of ongoing innovation, enabling aspirant inventors to expand on previously developed concepts for the good of society as a whole.
<p></p>
<h5>Selecting the Appropriate Patent Registration Office</h5>
<p></p>
<p>
    There are four jurisdictions in which the Indian Patent Office functions, each comprising certain states and union territories:
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    1.States of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Chhattisgarh, and union territories of Daman & Diu and Dadra & Nagar Haveli are covered by the Mumbai Patent Office.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    2.	States of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and the Union Territories of Pondicherry and Lakshadweep are covered by the Chennai Patent Office
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    3.	States of Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, and the Union Territories of Chandigarh are covered by the New Delhi Patent Office.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    4.	India’s remaining patent offices are in Kolkata.

</ul>
<p></p>
<h4>Registration of patent under PCT </h4>
<p></p>
<p>
    The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which provides a passport to acquire patent protection for ideas across several nations, emerges as a potent instrument in the changing environment of innovation. Through the expedited pathway of this international patent application procedure, applicants from the PCT Contracting States can submit applications concurrently. Let’s take an interesting journey of the PCT, where invention has no bounds and borders vanish.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    1. PCT Registration and Assignment
       International patent applications filed with the national patent office or, at the applicant’s option, with the International Bureau of WIPO in Geneva are accepted by the PCT, enabling persons from the PCT Contracting States to apply. There are alternate filing alternatives with regional patent offices for applicants from certain regions, such as Europe, Africa, or Eurasia.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    2. Formal PCT Requirements and Worldwide Search
       The formal conditions for overseas applications are carefully regulated by the PCT. The PCT has a significant effect upon filing as it automatically designates every Contracting State on the date of the worldwide filing. A thorough international search report and a preliminary written opinion on patentability are the outcomes of an international search carried out by qualified International Searching Authorities (ISA).
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    3. Assessment and Publication
       The search report and opinion are sent to applicants, who use them as a foundation for important choices. They have the option to move on with the application, withdraw, or change their claims. The worldwide application and search report are released through PATENTSCOPE and other platforms, increasing transparency, if they are not withdrawn.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    4. National Phase and Supplementary International Searching Authority (SISA)
       In order to minimize surprises during the national phase, applicants have the option to obtain a Supplementary International Searching Authority (SISA) before the 22-month mark in order to undertake an extra search. After the 30th month, applicants can start the national phase, when they apply for national or regional patents.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    5. Preliminary International Examination Option
       Requests for an optional international preliminary evaluation are available for those looking for further assurance and possible changes. The outcome is an international preliminary report on patentability (also known as IPRP Chapter II), which offers a solid foundation for additional legal action.
</p>
<p></p>
<h5>Benefits of PCT The PCT has several benefits:</h5>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Extended Decision Period: Applicants are granted a further 18 months to consider international protection, designate agents, and get translations ready.</li>
    <li>Formal Rejection Assurance: Rejection on formal grounds is avoided during the national phase if the PCT-mandated form criteria are fulfilled.</li>
    <li>Making Well-Informed Decisions: Written opinions and international search reports provide applicants with the ability to evaluate the likelihood of patentability.</li>
    <li>Effective Patent Office Procedures: The written opinion and search report help national patent offices cut down on or do away with needless labor.</li>
    <li>Fast-Track Examination: In Contracting States, PCT-PPH agreements permit rapid examination.</li>
    <li>Worldwide Notice and Advertising: By publishing applications on PATENTSCOPE, an international audience is made aware of them, which helps in the search for possible licensees.</li>  
</ul>
<p></p>
<h5>Assembly of the PCT Union and Special Measures</h5>
<p></p>
<p>
    All PCT States are members of the PCT Union Assembly, which is in charge of overseeing budgets, fee schedules, and modifications. Applicants from low-income countries receive special treatment in the form of large fee discounts.   
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>UNRAVELING THE MYSTERIES OF SECTION 3 & 4 OF THE INDIAN PATENT ACT</h2>
<p></p>
<h5>Section 3: What doesn’t make the cut as an Invention?</h5>
<p></p>
<p>When it comes to Patent in India not everything under the sun can be patented as invention. Section 3 of the Indian Patent Act, 1970 basically states what cannot be Patented.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>3 (a) Frivolous or Contrary to Natural Laws:</h5>
<p></p>
<p>Ever heard of perpetual motion machine? Sounds like a dream, right? Well, that’s exactly what cannot be patented – it’s scientifically impossible!!!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example: A machine that claims to run forever without energy loss cannot be patented.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>3 (b) Contrary to public morality or health </h5>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine a device designed exclusively for gambling or method to clone humans. These are just not controversial but downright not patentable!!!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example: Human Cloning Technique </p>
<p></p>
<h5>3 (c) Mere discovery of Natural Principles or Substance</h5>
<p></p>
<p>Discovering a scientific principle or a new type of bacteria in your backyard might earn you accolades but not a patent.</p>
<p></p>
<p> Example: E=mc^2 or a new mineral</p>
<p></p>
<h5>3 (d) New forms of known substance</h5>
<p></p>
<p>Found a new form of a known drug? If it doesn’t work better, it may not make the patent cut.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example: Different crystallin forms of a drug without improved efficacy. </p>
<p></p>
<h5>3 (e) Mere Admixture</h5>
<p></p>
<p>Mixing two substances to get a combo with no new properties? Is a no-go for patent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example: Blend of two chemical substances that act just like a separate component. </p>
<p></p>
<h5>3 (f) Arrangement or Re-arrangement</h5>
<p></p>
<p>Simply arranging or rearranging known devices to work together doesn’t mean it is new substance, it is just the existing substance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example: Combining a fan and a heater in a single unit.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>3 (g) Method of Agriculture and horticulture</h5>
<p></p>
<p>New framing technique or gardening methods no matter how innovative, aren’t patentable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example: New method of pruning trees.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>3 (h) Any process for the Medicinal, Surgical, Curative, Prophylactic, Diagnostic, Therapeutic or other treatment.</h5>
<p></p>
<p>Medical treatment for humans and animals is excluded to ensure accessibility and public health.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example: A new surgical technique.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>3 (i) Plants and Animals in whole or any part</h5>
<p></p>
<p>Biological processes, plants and animals (excluding microorganism) are kept outside the patentable domain to protect biodiversity. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Example: A genetically modified plant variety.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>3 (j) Mathematical or Business Method or a Computer Program Per Se</h5>
<p></p>
<p>Abstract ideas like mathematical formulas, business strategies, and standalone software programs aren’t patentable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example: An algorithm for financial trading.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>3 (k) Literary, Dramatic, Musical or Artistic Works</h5>
<p></p>
<p>Creative works are protected under Copyright law and not Patent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example: A novel, a painting or a musical composition. </p>
<p></p>
<h5>3 (l) Mere Scheme or Rule or Method of Performing Mental Act or Playing Game</h5>
<p></p>
<p>Simple Scheme or rules, like those for games or mental activities, don’t qualify as invention.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example: Rules for a board game.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>3 (m) Presentation of Information </h5>
<p></p>
<p>Ways for presenting an information not matter how innovative it is it cannot be patented. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Example: A new format for displaying data.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>3 (n) Topography of integrated circuits</h5>
<p></p>
<p>The layout designs of Circuits are protected under Specific Law (Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Layout-Designs Act, 2000) and not under Patent Act.</p>
<p></p>
<p> Example: The Layout design of microchip.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>3 (o) Traditional Knowledge </h5>
<p></p>
<p>Aged-old knowledge, especially that knowns to the Indigenous Community are not considered as an Invention.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example: Herbal remedies known for generations. </p>
<p></p>

<h1> Understanding Section 25 of the Indian Patent Act 1970: Opposition to Patents</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Navigating the intricacies of patent law can be daunting, but it is crucial for innovators and businesses to understand how to protect their intellectual property. Section 25 of the Indian Patent Act 1970 plays a pivotal role in this regard, outlining the mechanisms for pre-grant and post-grant opposition to patents. This section offers a structured way for the public and stakeholders to challenge patent applications and granted patents, ensuring that only deserving inventions receive protection.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What is Patent Opposition?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Patent opposition is a formal process by which individuals or entities can challenge the validity of a patent application or a granted patent. This serves as a quality control mechanism, preventing the grant of patents that do not meet the required legal and technical standards.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Pre-Grant Opposition (Section 25(1))</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Pre-grant opposition allows any person to oppose a patent application before it is granted. Once a patent application is filed, the details of the invention are made public. This transparency provides an opportunity for anyone to scrutinize the application and raise objections.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Grounds for Pre-Grant Opposition:</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Opposition can be based on various grounds, such as:</p>
<p></p>
<p>• The invention being wrongfully obtained.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Anticipation by prior publication or prior date.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Prior public knowledge or public use in India.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Lack of inventive step or obviousness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Non-patentable subject matter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Insufficiency in the description of the invention.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Non-disclosure of required information or provision of false information.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Non-filing of the patent application within 12 months in a convention country.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Incorrect mention of the source of biological material.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Anticipation based on traditional knowledge.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To file a pre-grant opposition, Form 7A must be submitted to the Indian Patent Office. Importantly, there are no fees associated with filing a pre-grant opposition, making it accessible for any member of the public to challenge potentially undeserving patent applications.</p>
<p></p>
<h3> Post-Grant Opposition (Section 25(2))</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Post-grant opposition comes into play after a patent has been granted. Unlike pre-grant opposition, only a “person interested” can file a post-grant opposition. This typically refers to individuals or entities engaged in or promoting the same field of invention.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Grounds for Post-Grant Opposition:</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The grounds for post-grant opposition are similar to those for pre-grant opposition, including:</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Wrongful obtaining of the invention.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Anticipation by prior publication or date.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Prior claiming in India.</p>
<P></P>
<p>• Public knowledge or use in India.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Obviousness and lack of inventive step.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Non-patentable subject matter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Insufficient description.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Non-disclosure of information or provision of false information.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Delay in filing the patent application within the stipulated time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Incorrect source mention of biological material.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Anticipation by traditional knowledge.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To initiate a post-grant opposition, Form 7 must be submitted along with the required statutory fees. The post-grant opposition can be filed at any time after the grant of the patent but must be within one year from the date of publication of the patent grant.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Key Differences between Pre-Grant and Post-Grant Opposition</h2>
<p></p>
<p>1. Eligibility to File: Any person can file a pre-grant opposition, while only a “person interested” can file a post-grant opposition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Timing: Pre-grant opposition is filed before the patent is granted, whereas post-grant opposition is filed after the patent is granted but within one year of its publication.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Fees: No fees are required for pre-grant opposition, whereas post-grant opposition requires the payment of statutory fees.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Infringement Proceedings: Infringement proceedings cannot be initiated during pre-grant opposition as the patent has not yet been granted. However, infringement proceedings can occur in the case of post-grant opposition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Opportunity for Hearing: Section 25(1) does not explicitly provide the patent applicant an opportunity to be heard in pre-grant opposition. In contrast, post-grant opposition allows for hearings in a conventional court setting.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Challenges and Considerations</h2>
<p></p>
<p>One significant drawback of pre-grant opposition is the potential for abuse by competitors. They can file frivolous oppositions to delay the grant of a patent, effectively shortening the effective life of the patent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the opposition mechanisms under Section 25 are vital for maintaining the integrity of the patent system in India. They ensure that only inventions meeting the stringent criteria of novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability are granted patent protection.</p>
<p></p>
<h2> Conclusion</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Understanding the opposition mechanisms under Section 25 of the Indian Patent Act 1970 is essential for anyone involved in the field of innovation and intellectual property. By providing avenues for pre-grant and post-grant opposition, the Act ensures that the patent system remains robust and fair, fostering genuine innovation while preventing the misuse of patent rights.</p>
